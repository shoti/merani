# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Prepare the 1.0 stability contract: versioned unambiguous source/content
  fingerprints, independent entry manifests for commit equivalence, strict
  persisted-final validation, and conservative rejection of insufficient
  legacy equivalence evidence. Reject unsupported directory and special-file
  task entries instead of collapsing them into one empty-content identity.
- Write provider attempt receipts before launch and settle them independently
  of later source or report failures. Unify run/resume cancellation, terminate
  owned descendants within a bounded grace period, preserve completed peers,
  and retain private bounded diagnostics for malformed or truncated output.
  Drain every provider through bounded pipes and stop owned process groups when
  either stream exceeds its limit, so temporary storage cannot grow unchecked.
  Serialize error and terminal metadata updates with attempt receipts so a
  concurrent whole-document write cannot erase a provider settlement.
- Enforce the three-tool filesystem MCP JSON-RPC and input contracts with
  bounded work, truthful incomplete-search/read results, and private receipts
  that feed the final coverage gate. Require Claude CLI 2.1.248+ restricted
  evaluation mode, filter each provider environment, and publish support
  boundaries through `doctor`.
- Add deterministic bundle identity across executable modules and policy
  references while retaining `runner_sha256` meaning. Replace local
  `deployment_ready` claims with `review_commit_ready`; keep the former as an
  always-false deprecated alias.
- Keep commit, push, and pull-request authority separate; run CI for the
  `shoti/merani-v1-stability-*` handoff branch prefix; and detect package-alias
  cycles in the architecture guard.
- Scope Claude authentication evidence to the process boundary: report a
  sandbox-local `loggedIn: false` result as `boundary_unavailable` instead of
  claiming that an authenticated host session is logged out.
- Preserve `USER` in Claude's filtered process environment so macOS account
  lookup can see the authenticated session without inheriting unrelated
  credentials.

- Introduce the internal `merani_core` modular-monolith package. Runtime paths,
  pure workflow/budget/gate policy, provider commands and response decoding,
  private storage and locks, query caches, and CLI presentation now have named
  owners while the existing launcher, state formats, and safety gates remain
  compatible. Add dependency/cycle checks and nested test discovery on Linux
  and macOS with Python 3.12 and 3.13.
- Preserve the pending authentication-readiness invariant independently in the
  extracted Claude adapter: definite logged-out status blocks before launch,
  while unavailable or unparseable status remains unknown and permitted.

- Pin required check names on each repository's first review with `--required-check`.
  Missing declared results block finalization; confirmation, supplemental reviews,
  and reused successor contracts retain the list. Results remain controller-reported.
- Keep informational observations in reports and final artifacts without requiring
  acknowledgement. Findings and test gaps still require decisions.
- Shorten the skill entrypoint and slash command; load recovery, provider, and
  authorized GitHub handoff instructions only when needed.

- Rename the project, plugin, skill, and command to Merani. See
  [upgrade notes](docs/upgrading.md) for installation and compatibility details.
- Shorten the README and public descriptions; state the review and evidence limits
  directly. Preserve existing configuration, review history, and legacy environment overrides.

- Require structured required-check results for a passing final. Failed, unrun
  and missing checks block readiness even with passing review verdicts, including
  pre-existing suite failures. Verification prose remains supplemental evidence.
- Validate check outcomes again during final verification and workflow readiness;
  historical finals without structured results are readable but not readiness proof.
- Document final-branch and post-push CI verification responsibilities.

All notable user-visible changes are documented here. This project follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

### Fixed

- Verify archived snapshot blobs against Git object IDs and restore transformed
  `export-subst` content so reviewers inspect the exact selected source bytes.
- Validate structured reviewer reports locally before rendering: malformed
  field types, missing fields, and actionable observations cannot turn into
  clean findings or complete coverage through coercion. A present non-object
  Claude payload cannot fall back to clean Markdown; explicit provider errors
  retain their typed failure category.
- Reject free-form findings sections with unrecognized headings or unstructured
  defect prose instead of silently discarding their contents from triage,
  including unknown top-level headings that would terminate section parsing
  and mixed bullet/heading test gaps that would drop leading items.
- Reject a Codex report unless its stream includes a subsequent completed turn;
  preserve the failed attempt and allow normal unchanged-source resume.
- Classify expired Claude OAuth sessions as authentication failures so explicit
  Claude-to-Codex substitution remains available with the original evidence.
- Clarify headless reviewer completion and instruction precedence for GPT-6,
  use the structured output instruction for both Claude and Codex, and put tool
  limitations under Coverage consistently. Document separate controller and
  reviewer model selection without changing saved provider preferences.

- Open evidence-memory search and status queries through a true read-only
  SQLite connection, avoiding schema and permission writes for logical reads.
- Decode malformed output bytes from non-Codex reviewer processes with
  replacement handling so an attempt returns auditable diagnostics instead of
  escaping as an uncaught `UnicodeDecodeError`.

- Support repositories whose `HEAD` has an empty tree but whose review scope
  contains untracked implementation files, instead of failing while opening
  Git's header-only archive.
- Stop Codex reviewer attempts after repeated persistent DNS-resolution
  failures, including stderr fragments without newline terminators, and record
  a typed `network` failure instead of waiting for the full review timeout.
  Replace malformed provider bytes during raw pipe decoding so a reader thread
  cannot fail silently and truncate review evidence or disable the watchdog.
- Require a linked successor when confirmation or supplemental source changes
  before Codex finalization, rather than recommending a final verdict against
  a stale snapshot.
- Convert private artifact-store permission failures into actionable errors and
  support `MM_REVIEW_RUNS_DIR` / `MM_REVIEW_CONFIG_DIR` for hosts whose Codex
  sandbox cannot write the default state locations.

- Block repair before provider invocation when the remaining attempt allowance
  cannot reach mandatory confirmation, or when a last-chance Claude call is
  below a medium/high-confidence historical stop recommendation. Preserve the
  evidence in the preflight artifact without consuming an attempt, including
  for an underfunded final confirmation attempt.
- Make external-I/O amplification inside changed loops an explicit reviewer and
  Codex-triage concern instead of an unbenchmarked note or speculative test gap.
- Isolate every provider in a per-attempt input directory so resumed reviewers
  cannot read peer reports, Codex triage, workflow summaries, or run metadata.
- Restore tracked `export-ignore` files to immutable snapshots from raw Git
  blobs without invoking repository-configured checkout filters.
- Clear all matching ancestor deferrals when a later lineage decision resolves
  the item, normalize legacy analytics timestamps, and make missing-workflow
  gate errors actionable.
- Reclaim dead provider-attempt reservations, expose live reservations in
  status/headroom, release them during stale-run recovery, and serialize review
  creation so concurrent preflights cannot duplicate a round.
- Redact configured secret shapes from persisted provider failures and stderr,
  scan complete non-binary files plus deleted YAML separator lines, and keep
  exact sensitive-approval identities stable.
- Cache workflow-audit metadata and lineage indexes for one report, batch
  evidence-memory searches, report malformed rebuild inputs as skipped, and
  preserve the original finding ID when a legacy finding becomes an
  observation.
- Compile every runtime module in CI and buffer unittest output so failures are
  not buried in successful command diagnostics.

### Added

- Add `assure-batch` to record multiple Claim-to-Evidence Assurance decisions
  under one artifact lock. The command validates and applies the complete batch
  in memory before writing, rejects duplicate claim IDs, and leaves both
  assurance artifacts unchanged when any item fails.
- Add a Claim-to-Evidence Assurance Matrix with stable acceptance-criterion and
  critical-invariant IDs, criterion-level reviewer coverage, atomic Codex-owned
  evidence decisions, source-fingerprint binding, conservative finalization,
  machine and human artifacts, successor-enforced contract drift, and honest
  legacy classification.

- Add an opt-in Codex reviewer adapter that runs an ephemeral, globally
  user-config-isolated, approval-free, schema-constrained `codex exec` session
  against the same
  private immutable snapshot. Require Codex CLI 0.138.0 or newer and use a
  custom permission profile that denies host reads, writes, and reviewer
  command network access while granting read access only to the snapshot and
  staged inputs. Restrict the child process to a minimal non-secret
  environment, disable shell, unified exec, command network, browser,
  connector, and delegation surfaces, and expose an embedded root-validating
  read/search MCP server as a direct-only namespace. Stage ChatGPT credentials
  in an ephemeral private `CODEX_HOME`, and reject API-key or keyring-backed
  authentication.
- Allow an explicit `resume --replace-failed-claude-with-codex` substitution
  after typed Claude quota, authentication, or budget-stop failures while
  preserving the failed attempt, source fingerprint, and honest same-provider-
  family coverage metadata.

- Record the exact plugin name/version, bundle root, runner path, and runner
  SHA-256 in diagnostics, status output, and every run artifact.
- Produce concise, evidence-aware GitHub PR descriptions after an explicitly
  authorized commit and push, with separate shapes for production-evidenced
  fixes, ordinary fixes, and new features.
- Treat an explicit commit-and-push request as authority to create the branch's
  PR with the generated description or update its open PR, including target
  verification, existing-body protection, private body files, post-write
  verification, and strict exclusion of unrelated PR mutations or extra scopes.
- Add provenance-bound `--exclude-snapshot-path` support for exact unchanged
  tracked sensitive files, with pinned contracts, freshness/resume validation,
  manifest disclosure, and mandatory Codex coverage compensation.
- Add schema-11 content-hash identities and explicit lineage reuse for already
  inspected sensitive-content findings; new or changed findings still require a
  one-shot scan token.
- Add structured reviewer observations with mandatory Codex acknowledgment so
  risk-relevant concerns cannot disappear into free-form Notes.
- Add confirmation recovery-headroom warnings and an audited, increase-only
  `workflow raise-provider-attempt-limit` command.
- Add explicit working-tree, immutable-commit, and attested-commit bindings,
  plus separate source-gate `ready` and `deployment_ready` status.
- Require recorded formatter, lint/static-check, and full relevant local-test
  evidence after fixes before another provider call, including across linked
  successor workflows, and allow successors to reuse the pinned lineage
  contract without resetting that gate. Evidence satisfies the gate for the
  exact reviewed fingerprint and is required again after later source changes.

- Add usage-aware `continue` and consolidated `gate` commands. Continuation is
  read-only by default, can consume one provider-review step only with explicit
  authorization or an `auto` provider-use policy, and never fabricates triage
  or a Codex verdict.
- Add provider authentication/resource metadata, quota cooldown evidence,
  per-provider attempt ceilings and atomic reservations across successor
  lineages, plus explicit `unknown` remaining allowance when a CLI does not
  expose it.

- Scan every file in the complete outgoing reviewer snapshot, bind approved
  redacted findings to that snapshot's content fingerprint, and reject direct
  reusable finding IDs and broad sensitive-path overrides.
- Protect a 10% Claude provider-overrun reserve and enforce a history-backed
  minimum viable provider budget before launch.
- Classify legacy finals without the structured Codex verdict contract as
  untrusted in verification, workflow status, and workflow audit.

- Add structured reviewer coverage declarations, persist reviewer notes and
  unreviewed changed paths, expose coverage analytics, and require explicit
  Codex compensation before incomplete confirmation coverage can finalize.
- Separate preflight-blocked attempts from failed reviews and provider
  invocation failures in workflow status and analytics.

- Add lineage-wide budget accounting so linked successors retain every
  ancestor's reported spend and active reservations.
- Add a private, dependency-free SQLite evidence index with rebuild, status,
  and search commands; retrieval remains Codex-only and post-review.
- Add one-round supplemental rechecks for focused questions about unchanged
  finalized content, with explicit non-authoritative `supplemental.json` output.
- Add conservative review-mode recommendations and lineage-level analytics for
  outcomes, cost, duration, and single-repository run finals.
- Add explicit workflow states and completion so finalized work no longer
  appears indefinitely active.
- Separate closed-workflow analytics from workflows that merely have a
  repository run final, and reject `supersede --by` budget mismatches.
- Normalize explicitly no-impact/no-action low-severity items into non-gating
  observations instead of requiring false triage work, while retaining medium,
  high, and blocker items as findings, persisting observations for audit, and
  treating observation-only `PASS_WITH_FINDINGS` reports as clean.
- Add pinned `fast`, `balanced`, and `deep` workflow modes that adapt repair
  limits and Claude effort while retaining mandatory confirmation.
- Break out review-mode runtime, spend, success, finding, and test-gap metrics
  in local analytics so the adaptive policy can be tuned from real outcomes.
- Add `disable <provider> --lock` so an unavailable provider cannot be restored
  accidentally by a one-run override.
- Add provider-reported token analytics by provider, model, review mode, and
  phase, plus artifact-byte totals by mode and phase, without estimating
  unavailable usage.
- Add opt-in compact output for analytics, workflow status, and evidence search;
  full JSON remains the default and compact rendering falls back when larger.
- Rank evidence memory across titles, locations, evidence, actions, and
  verification so concise symbol/path/topic queries can retrieve verified work.
- Separate explicit adaptive-mode lineage evidence from modes inferred for
  legacy workflows, and report unclassified run records and distributions.
- Add a read-only `workflow audit` that identifies pending triage, unclosed run
  finals, failed workflows, and stale incomplete work without mutating history.
- Add advisory historical API-equivalent estimates for the current patch and
  record the estimate before allowance-consuming reviews without changing
  effort or stops automatically.
- Add explicit useful/irrelevant/mixed feedback for attached memory candidates
  and report memory recall, structural matches, similarity, and assessments.
- Extract dependency-free token, artifact, and distribution primitives into a
  focused metrics module while keeping workflow orchestration in the runner.

- Preserve every failed/resumed reviewer attempt and archive its provider
  artifacts so analytics and workflow spend include paid retries.
- Add explicit one-resume Claude effort and budget overrides, plus a typed
  `budget_exhausted` failure category.
- Add `run --reuse-contract` for drift-proof confirmation rounds and record
  changed paths excluded by task filters.
- Flag legacy resumed artifacts whose overwritten attempt history cannot be
  reconstructed, instead of presenting their spend as complete.
- Resume partial runs against their original immutable snapshot without
  reinvoking successful reviewers.
- Enforce a configurable cumulative Claude budget across every workflow.
- Add explicit successor workflow lineage for intentional post-confirmation or
  contract changes.
- Add fingerprint-bound, one-shot approvals for inspected secret-scan findings.
- Add local evidence analytics for workflows, providers, failures, spend, and
  decisions.
- Validate the configured Kimi model alias before a review starts.

### Changed

- Disabled providers now report `disabled`, enabled but unprobed providers
  report `not_probed`, and neither is labeled ready. Successful Claude runs
  persist redacted authentication/resource classification, while workflow
  coverage headlines name only providers that actually returned evidence.
- Reviewer Notes are limited to neutral context; possible defects, missing
  tests, risks, and coverage limitations must use their structured sections.

- New workflows use provider attempts and observed quota/readiness state rather
  than a cumulative dollar gate. Claude's required USD-denominated print-mode
  cap is retained and labeled as a client-side API-price equivalent, not
  subscription billing. Legacy workflows retain their original semantics for
  verification compatibility.

### Security

- Fail runs closed when Claude reports an API-price equivalent beyond either
  the protected legacy lineage reservation or, for allowance-aware workflows,
  its per-call emergency stop plus the 10% safety reserve. Preserve other
  reviewers' reports as audit evidence and give non-resumable recovery guidance
  that matches the lifecycle contract.

- Overlay task-scoped working-tree changes onto `--base` snapshots even when a
  branch file is reverted exactly to its base content, preventing reviewers
  from inspecting the stale `HEAD` version, and apply the same sensitive-path,
  symlink, content, and manifest coverage to those overlay-only files.
- Refuse to start Claude when less than `$0.25` remains in the lineage budget,
  avoiding paid overhead-only attempts that cannot produce a valid report.
- Prevent resumed attempts from replacing earlier reported usage and thereby
  weakening the cumulative workflow budget.
- Refuse a blind Claude resume after budget exhaustion until the operator
  chooses an explicit retry policy.
- Require Claude's JSON-schema report contract and normalize contradictory
  clean verdicts fail-closed.
- Preserve typed provider failures when terminal handling records an error.
- Avoid duplicate secret findings from overlapping patch and source scans while
  retaining coverage for deleted lines.
- Reject new runs and resumes under superseded workflows, and preserve partial
  state when an unexpected exception interrupts resume.
- Reserve workflow budget atomically across concurrent runs, recreate stale
  ephemeral snapshots on resume, narrow model-error classification, and retain
  simultaneous provider and report-contract failures in analytics.
- Serialize workflow supersession with budget reservation and release so
  lineage changes cannot lose concurrent accounting updates.
- Serialize overlapping resume attempts for one artifact across snapshot,
  provider, and evidence writes.

### Changed

- Make the documented `--reuse-contract` confirmation command scope-neutral so
  it works for pinned `--base` and `--commit` workflows as well as
  `--uncommitted` workflows.
- Allow a clean reviewed `--base` branch to resolve as committed-equivalent and
  be attested to its checked-out HEAD, with actionable failure diagnostics.

- Skip CLI and readiness probes for disabled providers in `status` and plain
  `doctor`.
- Reject budget-exhaustion retries that lower both Claude effort and budget.

- Accept an explicit scope selector with `--reuse-contract` when it resolves to
  the pinned scope, matching the documented confirmation command while still
  rejecting scope drift.
- Let path-filtered commit reviews ignore unrelated working-tree changes while
  retaining task-scoped cleanliness checks.
- Report newly started or superseding workflows with zero runs as active in
  `workflow status`, while still rejecting genuinely unknown workflow IDs.
- Extracted the reviewer report contract and parser into a focused module.
- Clarified the reviewer report contract so inspection-budget limitations are
  recorded in Notes instead of producing an empty `PASS_WITH_FINDINGS`.
- Recognize the first root commit as content-equivalent to a reviewed unborn
  working tree when paths and file contents match exactly.
