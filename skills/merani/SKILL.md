description: Get a second code review for Codex, verify findings, and keep decisions tied to the reviewed code. Use for consequential changes, requested second opinions, and final review before an authorized handoff.

# Merani

Keep reviewer output advisory. Codex owns the implementation, verifies every
finding, and makes the final decision. Reviewer sessions are always fresh and
read-only. The Codex reviewer is isolated from the controller conversation and
artifacts, but it is same-provider-family evidence, not an independent
external-model opinion. It requires ChatGPT authentication, receives a minimal
non-secret process environment, and exposes no shell or exec tool; never
forward API-key authentication to it.

The controller may use GPT-6 Astra without changing the workflow. The optional
Codex reviewer has a separate model selection: its isolated `CODEX_HOME`
excludes personal model/reasoning settings, and `default` means the installed
CLI's default. When GPT-6 reviewer coverage is requested, use
`--with-codex --codex-model gpt-6-astra` for repair and confirmation, or
`set-model codex gpt-6-astra` for an explicitly requested persistent setting.
Do not infer reviewer model identity from the controller's model. Preserve
existing explicit pins unless the user requests changing them.

Continue authorized inspection, fixes, and verification through the final gate.
Resolve routine workflow choices from the task context. Ask only when missing
information or authority materially affects the task; mandatory confirmation
means an independent review round, not another user approval prompt.

The runner requires Python 3.12 or newer. Resolve and verify the interpreter
before the first command; on macOS, `/usr/bin/python3` may still be Python 3.9.
An unsupported interpreter is rejected before workflow or provider activity.

Invoke the workflow with `/merani:review`, or mention
`$merani` in a prompt. The slash command accepts `uncommitted`,
`branch <base>`, or `commit <sha>`, plus `with-codex`, `without-codex`,
`with-antigravity`, `without-antigravity`, `with-kimi`, or `without-kimi`. The
former Gemini option names remain accepted as compatibility aliases.

## Run a gated workflow

1. Finish the implementation and its initial local checks. Do not review moving
   code.
2. Start one workflow ID for the entire user task:

```bash
merani workflow start --name "<task>" \
  --review-mode <fast|balanced|deep> --max-provider-attempts 6
```

Choose `fast` only for small, localized, low-risk changes; it permits one
low-effort repair before a medium-effort confirmation. Use `balanced` for
ordinary features and fixes; it permits two medium-effort repairs. Use `deep`
for auth, money, trading, database writes, migrations, email, security, or
broad cross-component changes; it retains the three-repair ceiling. Every mode
still requires a fresh confirmation round. The default is `balanced`.
Use `merani recommend` when the changed-path risk is unclear; its result is
advisory and any explicit risk label still recommends `deep`.
New workflows treat subscription allowance, provider attempts, quota cooldowns,
and token telemetry as the scarce resources. They do not enforce a cumulative
dollar cap. Claude still requires its native USD-denominated emergency stop in
print mode; artifacts label that number as an API-price equivalent, not a bill.
When historical exhaustion or an unfamiliar patch size makes Claude's native
per-call stop uncertain, inspect local evidence before starting:

```bash
merani budget-estimate --uncommitted \
  --review-mode <fast|balanced|deep> --claude-effort <effort>
```

Treat the recommendation as advisory while ordinary recovery headroom remains.
When a repair has exactly enough attempts left for repair plus mandatory
confirmation, or confirmation has only its final allowed attempt, the runner
fails closed before provider invocation if Claude's configured stop is below a
medium/high-confidence recommendation. It also blocks any repair that cannot
leave an attempt for confirmation. Raise the one-run stop to the recorded
recommendation or use the audited
`workflow raise-provider-attempt-limit` command to restore recovery headroom.
Never lower review quality from historical usage evidence. The runner records
provider authentication mode, readiness, attempts, quota cooldowns, and tokens;
remaining subscription allowance stays `unknown` when a provider does not
expose it.

3. Run repair round 1 in each affected repository. Round numbering is automatic
   when `--round` is omitted. Prefer repeatable `--path` filters over temporary
   clones when the working tree contains unrelated changes:

```bash
merani run --uncommitted \
  --workflow-id <workflow-id> --phase repair \
  --path src/feature --path test/feature \
  --risk db-write --review-profile data-change \
  --criterion 'RESULT-1=The requested behavior is preserved' \
  --critical-invariant 'SAFETY-1=The protected side effect fails closed' \
  --task "<intent and acceptance criteria>"
```

Use `--base <branch>` for a feature branch plus working-tree changes, or
`--commit <sha>` for one clean checked-out commit. Add every applicable risk:
`auth`, `backfill`, `db-write`, `email-send`, `email-deliverability`,
`external-api`, `migration`, `security`, or `trading`. Choose a matching
reviewer profile when useful: `normal`, `security`, `data-change`,
`external-api`, `trading`, or `email-deliverability`.

When `--path` excludes other dirty files, the runner prints and records those
paths locally. Inspect that notice before paying a provider: unrelated changes
may stay excluded, but a changed dependency needed by the reviewed behavior
must be included in the task contract.

An unchanged tracked file with a recognized sensitive name, such as `.npmrc`,
may remain in the original repository while being omitted from provider data:

```bash
merani run ... --exclude-snapshot-path .npmrc
```

The runner accepts only an exact regular tracked file that is clean against
`HEAD`, is not changed or task-scoped, and matches the sensitive-path policy.
It records the Git blob, SHA-256, size, and reason, removes only the private
snapshot copy, pins the exclusion in the review contract, verifies provenance
on resume/freshness checks, and requires Codex coverage compensation before a
final can pass. Never use an exclusion to hide task-relevant code.

If secret screening blocks intentional test material, inspect it with the same
scope and paths before invoking a provider:

```bash
merani scan --repo <repo> --uncommitted \
  --path src/feature --path test/feature --approve-findings
merani run ... --sensitive-scan-token <returned-token>
```

The initial approval is one-shot and bound to the exact repository, paths, findings,
task source fingerprint, and complete outgoing-snapshot content fingerprint.
It never approves sensitive paths or external symlinks. Direct reusable finding
IDs and broad sensitive-path overrides are rejected.
After that inspected approval, an unchanged schema-11 finding can be reused in
the same task lineage with `--reuse-lineage-sensitive-approvals`. Reuse requires
an exact match of path, line, rule, key, and line-content hash; any new or
changed finding still requires a new one-shot scan token.

4. Read every report and `review-summary.json`, including each reviewer's
   structured coverage declaration. Independently trace each finding and test
   gap through the real runtime or side-effect path. Record every disposition:

```bash
merani decide --run <run-dir> --finding claude-001 \
  --decision accepted \
  --evidence "<repository evidence>" \
  --action "<smallest fix>" \
  --verification "<focused reproduction or check>"
```

Use `accepted`, `fixed`, `rejected`, `deferred`, or `uncertain`. Model agreement
is not evidence. `accepted` and `uncertain` block the next round; after a fix,
record `fixed` on the original item with verification and changed scoped
source. A bounded medium/low
finding may be `deferred`; blocker/high findings cannot. For test gaps, use
`covered`, `rejected`, `deferred`, or `accepted`. An accepted gap blocks the
next round until changed to `covered`, `rejected`, or `deferred`; a deferred
item remains visible in `PASS_WITH_FINDINGS`. Marking a finding `fixed` or a
test gap `covered` requires verification and a changed scoped fingerprint.
Reviewer test gaps are contractually limited to medium/low. A blocker/high
test-gap heading makes the provider report invalid, and the triage/final gate
also refuses to defer such an item as defense in depth.
Reviewers must put demonstrably no-impact/no-action facts in the structured
`Observations` section, never in Notes. Codex must record `acknowledged` with
evidence for every observation before finalization. Any plausible risk or
recommended change remains a finding or test gap.
When the item includes `memory_matches`, record whether those candidates were
`useful`, `irrelevant`, or `mixed` with `--memory-assessment`. This feedback is
Codex-only telemetry and must not influence or enter independent reviewer
prompts.

Multiple decisions may run concurrently because the runner locks the complete
triage transaction. Prefer one atomic batch when decisions are already known:

```bash
merani decide-batch --run <run-dir> \
  --item '{"finding":"claude-001","decision":"rejected","evidence":"..."}' \
  --item '{"finding":"claude-test-001","decision":"covered","evidence":"..."}'
```

When the repair contract pins claims, every reviewer must separately declare
criterion-level coverage. Treat that declaration as advisory: Codex must attach
its own concrete repository, test, artifact, or safe runtime evidence to each
claim on the final fresh run:

```bash
merani assure --run <run-dir> --claim RESULT-1 \
  --status verified --evidence-kind test \
  --evidence "tests/feature_test.py::test_result passes"
```

When multiple claim decisions are known, prefer one atomic batch. Each item
uses the same fields and validation rules as `assure`; one invalid item leaves
both assurance artifacts unchanged:

```bash
merani assure-batch --run <run-dir> \
  --item '{"claim":"RESULT-1","status":"verified","evidence_kind":"test","evidence":"tests/feature_test.py::test_result passes"}' \
  --item '{"claim":"RESULT-2","status":"deferred","evidence_kind":"artifact","evidence":"artifact.json records the gap","rationale":"Deferred intentionally"}'
```

Claim IDs and exact text are pinned with the rest of the review contract.
Adding, changing, or dropping one requires an explicit linked successor;
`--reuse-contract` preserves them across repair, confirmation, and successor
lineage. Critical invariants cannot be deferred. A deliberately deferred
non-critical criterion requires concrete evidence plus a rationale and limits
the gate to `PASS_WITH_FINDINGS`. Reviewer agreement and numeric confidence are
never evidence. Legacy workflows remain readable as unassured; do not
retroactively synthesize claim coverage.

5. Fix only accepted findings/gaps. Before consuming another provider attempt,
   run the repository formatter, lint/static checks, and the complete relevant
   local test suite. Record their results with repeated `--local-verification`
   flags on the next `run`; the runner requires this evidence after a fixed
   finding or covered gap changes the scoped fingerprint. For database/API DSLs,
   verify exact option nesting and postconditions with a behavior-level test or
   safe runtime check; a mock that only proves a method was called is not enough.
6. Fully triage the current repair before starting the next. Any task-scoped
   code change invalidates the round. The runner enforces the selected mode's
   one-, two-, or three-repair limit and links exact repeated finding titles to earlier decisions without
   leaking prior findings into independent reviewer prompts. It pins scope,
   paths, risks, profile, and task from the first completed repair; start a new
   workflow instead of shrinking or changing that contract.

If one reviewer fails after another returns a valid report, the run becomes
`partial`. Keep the source unchanged and resume it so successful reviewers are
not invoked again:

```bash
merani resume --run <partial-run-dir>
```

Resume fails closed if the source fingerprint changed or a later completed
round already exists. Typed provider failures and the successful reports remain
in the same run artifact. Every failed and resumed attempt retains its own
metadata and archived provider artifacts, and every attempt counts toward the
cumulative provider-attempt ceiling.

If Claude reached its native per-review API-equivalent stop, do not blindly
repeat the same cap or lower both effort and the stop.
Resume the unchanged snapshot with an explicit one-attempt override:

```bash
merani resume --run <partial-run-dir> \
  --claude-max-budget-usd 2 --claude-effort medium
```

When Claude instead has a typed quota, authentication, or budget-stop failure,
the user may explicitly replace only that failed attempt with a fresh Codex
session against the same fingerprint-bound snapshot:

```bash
merani resume --run <partial-run-dir> \
  --replace-failed-claude-with-codex
```

The run preserves Claude's failed attempt and records the substitution. Report
the successful Codex review as fresh-session, same-provider-family coverage;
never describe it as an independent external-model review.

The provider-attempt ceiling still applies. A linked successor inherits every
ancestor's successful and failed provider attempts, so supersession cannot reset
task usage. If source, paths, or acceptance criteria must change, create a
linked successor instead of resuming. An existing usage-aware workflow supplied
through `workflow supersede --by` must have the exact same provider-usage policy.

7. When no further source change is planned, run one mandatory confirmation
   round:

```bash
merani run --workflow-id <workflow-id> \
  --phase confirmation --reuse-contract \
  --reuse-lineage-sensitive-approvals
```

`--reuse-contract` loads the first completed repair's exact scope, paths,
risks, profile, and task for that repository across the linked workflow
lineage, preventing accidental confirmation drift without letting a successor
reset post-fix local-verification requirements. Recorded evidence satisfies the
gate for that exact fingerprint; any later source change requires fresh
evidence. Omit the scope selector for a command that works with
`--uncommitted`, `--base`, and `--commit` repair contracts. An explicit scope
selector is accepted only when it resolves to the pinned scope.

Before confirmation, inspect the attempt-headroom warning from `continue`.
Confirmation should have its own attempt plus two recovery attempts available.
If the deliberate original ceiling is too tight, increase it explicitly and
auditably; it can never be lowered by this command:

```bash
merani workflow raise-provider-attempt-limit <workflow-id> --to <count> \
  --reason "reserve confirmation recovery headroom"
```

Use the usage-aware continuation helper whenever the next lifecycle step is
unclear:

```bash
merani continue <workflow-id>
```

It is read-only by default and returns the next exact action: initial review,
triage, repair, confirmation, provider wait, Codex finalization, or gate closure.
It includes provider authentication/resource mode, local attempt consumption,
known cooldown/reset evidence, and `unknown` where remaining provider allowance
is not observable. Disabled providers report `disabled`, unprobed providers
report `not_probed`, and neither is claimed as ready. The coverage headline
names only providers that actually returned successful review evidence. To
authorize one available provider-review step:

```bash
merani continue <workflow-id> --execute-review
```

Persistent `provider_use_policy=auto` makes the plain command execute one safe
review step automatically. It never fabricates triage decisions or Codex's
final verdict.

8. Triage the confirmation, perform Codex's final diff review, and finalize it:

```bash
merani finalize --run <run-dir> \
  --codex-verdict <PASS_CLEAN|PASS_WITH_FINDINGS|BLOCK> \
  --check-result '{"name":"required tests","status":"passed","exit_code":0,"evidence":"Full required suite passed on the reviewed source."}' \
  --codex-review "<final review result>" \
  --verification "<command/check: result>"
merani verify --run <run-dir>
```

The consolidated gate can perform the same finalization, verification, optional
checked-out-HEAD attestation, and workflow closure:

```bash
merani gate <workflow-id> \
  --codex-verdict <PASS_CLEAN|PASS_WITH_FINDINGS|BLOCK> \
  --check-result '{"name":"required tests","status":"passed","exit_code":0,"evidence":"Full required suite passed on the reviewed source."}' \
  --codex-review "<evidence-backed final review>" \
  --verification "<command/check: result>" \
  --attest-commit
```

Without a Codex verdict it reports `NEEDS_CODEX_FINAL`; without a mandatory
confirmation it reports the exact `continue` action. `gate` does not invoke a
provider unless `--execute-review` is explicitly supplied.

Before any passing final or commit/push handoff, run the required repository and
CI checks against the final combined branch, including changes integrated from
the remote. Record every required check with `--check-result` JSON containing
`name`, `status` (`passed`, `failed`, or `not_run`), `exit_code` (integer, or null
for `not_run`), and concrete non-secret `evidence`. Names must be unique; report
the latest result for each check. A passing check requires exit code zero.
Failed, unrun, or missing check results force `BLOCK`, even when Codex or all
reviewers say PASS. `--verification` is supplemental prose, not a passing check.

An existing failure is still a failed required check. Do not defer, relabel, or
omit a known failure because it predates the patch or falls outside `--path`.
Fix it when authorized and practical, or report the blocked handoff. Run the
full required test suite when feasible; focused tests and green lint cannot
establish a green suite. Static reviewers cannot certify tests they did not run.
After pushing, inspect CI for the pushed SHA and report pending/failed checks
separately from local checks. A push or review PASS never proves CI success.

The runner validates controller-reported check results; it does not execute the
commands or independently discover omitted CI jobs. Codex remains responsible
for truthful results and complete required-check selection. Historical finals
without structured validation remain readable but cannot establish readiness;
refinalize unchanged reviewed source with fresh check results before attestation.

If a successful confirmation reviewer explicitly reports incomplete coverage,
finalization fails closed. Run another independent review, or inspect every
named path and limitation yourself and persist concrete compensation:

```bash
merani finalize --run <run-dir> \
  --codex-verdict <PASS_CLEAN|PASS_WITH_FINDINGS|BLOCK> \
  --check-result '{"name":"required tests","status":"passed","exit_code":0,"evidence":"Full required suite passed on the reviewed source."}' \
  --codex-review "<final review result>" \
  --verification "<command/check: result>" \
  --coverage-verification "Read <paths> fully and traced <call paths>: <result>"
```

Coverage compensation is not a generic acknowledgement. It must identify the
uncovered files or behavior and the evidence Codex checked. Provider coverage,
unreviewed paths, and limitations remain visible in `review-summary.json` and
`triage.json`; the final gate additionally records Codex's compensation.
Aggregate coverage remains visible in workflow metrics and analytics.

`finalize` accepts only the confirmation round for new workflows and requires
Codex's explicit structured verdict. It produces the more conservative result
of that verdict and the complete triage history for the repository workflow:
`PASS_CLEAN`, `PASS_WITH_FINDINGS`, or `BLOCK`. Earlier deferred or otherwise
unresolved items remain visible with run-qualified IDs, and deferrals from
superseded task-lineage ancestors carry forward until a later matching decision
resolves them. Verification hashes the complete triage set and fails closed if
any recorded decision changes after finalization. It refuses stale source,
pending findings/test gaps, accepted unresolved test gaps, risk-profiled runs
without verification, incomplete claim assurance, and accepted/uncertain
blocker or high confirmation findings. It writes fingerprint-bound
`assurance.json` and `assurance.md`; changing source or assurance decisions
invalidates the final hash.
If finalized confirmation later becomes stale because scoped source changes,
`continue` reports `NEEDS_SUCCESSOR` and prints the exact non-automatic
successor command. A completed confirmation intentionally closes its workflow:

```bash
merani workflow supersede <workflow-id> --reason "<contract or source change>"
```

The successor inherits every repository represented in the superseded lineage.
Each one must receive a fresh successor review and final; status reports an
inherited repository with no successor run as `not-reviewed`, `continue` names
the missing repository, and workflow finalization remains blocked.

Close every workflow after all repositories pass, including single-repository
tasks:

```bash
merani workflow finalize <workflow-id>
```

`workflow status` and the read-only `workflow audit` distinguish active work,
`ready_to_finalize`, `completed`, `completed_stale`, blocked, and superseded
states using current source evidence. A persisted completed marker does not
hide a stale final. A completed workflow rejects new reviews; create a linked
successor for a source or contract change.
It also distinguishes `ready` (fresh local source gate) from
`deployment_ready` (an immutable commit review or explicit commit attestation).
After committing exact reviewed bytes, run the exact `attest-commit` action
shown by `workflow finalize` or `continue`, then verify again. Neither provider
review nor commit attestation proves a deployed runtime, live data, broker,
email, or API side effect; obtain that application-specific runtime evidence
separately whenever the task requires it.

If a finalized snapshot is unchanged and the user asks one additional focused
question, use one supplemental review instead of another repair/confirmation
pair:

```bash
merani run --supplemental-of <finalized-run-dir> \
  --task "<focused additional concern>"
merani finalize --run <supplemental-run-dir> \
  --codex-verdict <PASS_CLEAN|PASS_WITH_FINDINGS|BLOCK> \
  --check-result '{"name":"required tests","status":"passed","exit_code":0,"evidence":"Full required suite passed on the reviewed source."}' \
  --codex-review "<focused Codex verification>"
merani verify --run <supplemental-run-dir>
```

The runner verifies exact content equivalence and writes `supplemental.json`.
Supplemental evidence never replaces the parent final gate. Any accepted issue
that changes source requires a normal successor workflow. Repeated supplemental
siblings share the parent's provider-attempt lineage and reservations.

Never claim a final PASS from an external report alone. The authoritative gate
is a fresh `final.json` plus the completed workflow final. A supplemental file
adds focused evidence but is never an authoritative replacement gate.

If the user later authorizes a commit, bind the reviewed snapshot to it without
rerunning unchanged code:

```bash
merani attest-commit --run <run-dir> --commit HEAD
merani verify --run <run-dir>
```

The runner proves the checked-out commit is task-scope content-equivalent to the
reviewed working tree or clean `--base` branch. A real scoped edit still
invalidates the gate. If attestation fails, report that failure explicitly;
do not imply that the commit was bound merely because the branch head matches
its remote.

When the user explicitly authorizes both commit and push, also produce a
concise GitHub PR description after the push and write it to the branch's open
PR, or create the PR when none is open. This is part of the handoff even when
the user does not separately ask for PR copy. Base the description on the
verified task evidence and choose the matching shape:

- Evidence-based fix: `## Production evidence` gives the shortest useful
  causal timeline, impact/scope, and relevant current state; `## Fix` explains
  the behavior changed and the invariant now enforced.
- Fix without production evidence: `## Summary` explains the defect, impact,
  and verified root cause when known; `## Fix` explains the behavioral
  correction and why it addresses the problem.
- New feature: `## Summary` states the capability and why it exists;
  `## What changed` lists the important user-visible behavior, invariants, and
  operational controls.

Use only verified facts. Never manufacture production evidence or turn an
inference into a timeline claim. Prefer exact timestamps, counts, and durable
identifiers only when they materially establish causality or scope and are safe
to publish. Optimize for a human or AI reading the old PR later: preserve the
problem, why it happened, and the resulting behavior. Omit routine test-pass
lists, changed-file inventories, review workflow metadata, and low-level
implementation detail. Mention compatibility, rollout, migration, or known
limitations only when they materially affect the merge decision.

An explicit request to commit and push also authorizes creating the branch's PR
with the generated description or updating its open PR. A commit-only,
push-only, or copy-only request does not authorize a PR write. An explicit
open/create/update-PR request remains sufficient authority as well. These writes
require an authenticated GitHub CLI:

1. Run `gh auth status --hostname github.com` without printing or retrieving the
   token. Verify the authenticated account, repository owner/name, remote,
   current branch, pushed HEAD, and intended base branch. Stop and ask if any of
   them are ambiguous or mismatched.
2. Look up open PRs for the exact head branch before writing. If one exists,
   read its number, URL, state, title, body, base, and head. If none is open, a
   commit-and-push or create-PR request authorizes creating one against the
   verified base; an update-only request does not. Never reopen a closed PR
   unless explicitly requested. If an open PR body contains material human
   content rather than only the repository's blank template, show the proposed
   replacement and obtain explicit approval before overwriting it.
3. Create with explicit `--base`, `--head`, `--title`, and `--body-file`, or
   update the current branch's open PR with `gh pr edit --body-file`. Put the
   generated description in a private temporary file, never in shell-expanded
   command text, and remove the file after the command.
4. Do not add reviewers, assignees, labels, milestones, projects, auto-merge,
   merge actions, approvals, comments, or any other PR mutation unless the user
   explicitly authorizes that exact action. Do not request extra GitHub scopes
   merely to complete the PR description.
5. Read the PR back with `gh pr view` and verify the URL, base/head branches,
   title, and exact body. Report any mismatch or partial failure.

If GitHub CLI is missing, unauthenticated, or lacks access, stop the PR handoff
with the exact readiness problem after preserving any successful commit and
push. Still provide paste-ready PR copy, but never claim the description was
assigned on GitHub.

Do not commit, push, open a PR, deploy, or change production state unless the
user authorizes the applicable handoff as described above.

## Control reviewers

Claude is enabled by default. Codex, Antigravity, and Kimi remain disabled until
explicitly enabled, which avoids accidental allowance consumption or quota
retries. Use the
bundled runner so the plugin remains self-contained:

```bash
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/merani.py status
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/merani.py doctor
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/merani.py doctor --live

python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/merani.py set-model kimi k3-256k
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/merani.py set-model kimi k3
```

`set-effort` and `set-claude-usage-limit` change persistent defaults. Prefer
`run --claude-effort ... --claude-max-budget-usd ...` or the matching `resume`
flags for one review so temporary provider-native tuning does not leak into
later tasks. `set-budget` and `set-workflow-budget` remain compatibility aliases
for legacy configurations; new workflows do not use a cumulative dollar gate.

Use `--with-codex`, `--without-codex`, `--with-antigravity`,
`--without-antigravity`, `--with-kimi`, or `--without-kimi` for one-run
overrides. The Codex adapter runs `codex exec` ephemerally with global user
config isolated behind a temporary `CODEX_HOME`, approval requests disabled,
and the same structured report schema.
It requires Codex CLI 0.138.0 or newer, stages ChatGPT authentication in a
temporary private `CODEX_HOME`, and uses a custom permission profile that lets
only an embedded MCP server inspect the immutable snapshot and staged inputs.
Shell, unified exec, writes, command network access, browser, connector, and
delegation surfaces are disabled. The MCP namespace is direct-only and exposes
only root-validating `read_file`, `list_directory`, and literal `search` tools, so
host files and credential-manager processes are unreachable. The adapter
currently requires file-backed ChatGPT CLI credentials and rejects API-key or
keyring-backed
authentication because their isolation is not equivalently verified.
Antigravity model `auto` delegates
model routing to the installed CLI and avoids pinning the workflow to a
short-lived Gemini model name. Use `--antigravity-model <model>` or
`set-model antigravity <model>` only when the task requires an explicit model.
The runner rejects explicit models that `agy models` does not report.
`disable <provider> --lock` additionally rejects a `--with-<provider>` override
until the provider is explicitly enabled again. Disabled providers are not
probed by `status` or plain `doctor`.

For the current default, use capped Claude reviews. Use Codex when Claude is
unavailable and explicitly disclose that it is not cross-provider evidence.
Enable Antigravity for a
specific high-value independent review only after readiness and quota are
confirmed. When Kimi access becomes available, it can replace Antigravity or
join both reviewers for unusually high-risk work.
Prefer `k3-256k` for routine Kimi reviews and `k3` when the relevant context
cannot fit within 256K. State explicitly which reviewers actually ran.

When the optional `merani` PATH shortcut exists, it is equivalent to the
bundled Python command. Run `doctor` before the first review in a session when
CLI availability or model configuration is uncertain. It checks plugin/cache
parity, private storage modes, CLI flags, and static readiness; `doctor --live`
adds a tiny Claude probe capped at $0.10 and probes any other enabled provider.
Inspect the reported runtime plugin version, root, runner path, and SHA-256.
Artifacts persist the same identity. During local plugin development, invoke
the intended source runner directly; a cached runner can prove parity only for
the bundle it belongs to, not that a separate source checkout is newer.
If the host Codex sandbox cannot write the default `~/.codex/review-runs`
artifact store, set `MERANI_RUNS_DIR` to an absolute private writable
directory for the complete workflow; do not alternate stores within a lineage.
Interrupted reviews terminate their child process groups and are marked failed.
If a crash leaves running metadata whose recorded PID is no longer alive, use
`recover`; it refuses to overwrite a live process. Status calls `agy models`, so
Antigravity reports ready only when the CLI is installed, authenticated,
reachable, has at least one available model, and the hard read-only custom
agent matches the bundled definition. Run `agy` to authenticate or
`merani install-antigravity-agent` to repair the agent when readiness fails.
Kimi readiness calls `kimi provider list --json` and verifies that the selected
model alias is actually configured before any provider allowance is consumed.

## Apply review policy

Read [references/review-policy.md](references/review-policy.md) when triaging
findings, choosing whether another round is needed, or using Claude
`ultrareview` on a committed branch.
Read
[references/antigravity-reviewer.md](references/antigravity-reviewer.md) when
installing, authenticating, troubleshooting, or changing the Antigravity
adapter.

The runner:

- gives Claude, Codex, Antigravity, and Kimi fresh sessions with
  provider-specific staged inputs that exclude peer reports, metadata, and
  Codex triage; Codex remains explicitly classified as same-provider-family;
- restricts every reviewer to read/search tools;
- supports task-path scoping without copying dirty repositories;
- builds a private immutable repository snapshot so reviewers never inspect the
  live checkout while the user or another process may be changing it; `--path`
  scopes changed overlays, patches, and fingerprints, but the snapshot retains
  the tracked tree for review context;
- stores patches, prompts, CLI/model/timing/usage metadata, parsed findings,
  parsed test gaps, Codex triage, source fingerprints, and final gates under
  `~/.codex/review-runs/` with private permissions;
- blocks likely credential/key files, external symlinks, and high-confidence
  secret patterns across the complete outgoing snapshot plus deleted patch
  material, with redacted path/line/rule diagnostics and exact-snapshot
  one-shot waivers; sensitive paths and external symlinks always fail closed;
- checks source freshness after reviewers run and whenever a PASS is verified;
- recognizes an identical reviewed working tree after it becomes a commit;
- blocks new/final rounds when earlier completed rounds are incompletely triaged;
- pins an adaptive fast, balanced, or deep repair limit followed by a mandatory confirmation;
- pins each repository's scope, paths, risks, profile, and task across rounds;
- requires schema-constrained Claude and Codex output contracts and safely
  validates structured field types and required fields locally before rendering;
  safely normalizes contradictory verdicts and rejects unfinished Codex streams;
- requires structured reviewer coverage, persists notes and uncovered changed
  paths, and blocks finalization until incomplete confirmation coverage is
  independently rerun or explicitly compensated by Codex evidence;
- pins explicit acceptance criteria and critical invariants, requires exact
  reviewer criterion coverage plus concrete Codex-owned evidence, and folds the
  assurance result conservatively into finalization without fabricating legacy
  coverage;
- caps provider attempts cumulatively across the successor lineage with atomic
  per-run reservations, including concurrent repositories, and skips an
  exhausted provider when another enabled reviewer is ready;
- retains Claude's native per-review API-equivalent emergency stop without
  treating it as subscription billing; legacy workflows retain their original
  dollar-denominated lineage semantics for artifact compatibility;
- preserves valid reports when another provider fails and resumes only the
  failed reviewers against the same immutable source under a full-transaction
  run lock;
- permits an explicit Claude-to-Codex substitution only for typed quota,
  authentication, or budget-stop failures while preserving the failed Claude
  attempt and immutable source fingerprint;
- records typed provider failures without replacing them with generic terminal
  exceptions;
- classifies Claude native-stop exhaustion separately, rejects an unchanged
  blind retry, and supports explicit one-resume effort/stop overrides;
- preserves every resume attempt and its artifacts so analytics and cumulative
  provider-attempt enforcement include failed attempts;
- supports explicit successor workflow lineage after a closed confirmation or
  intentional contract change;
- issues exact-fingerprint, one-shot approvals for inspected secret-scan
  findings, bound to the complete outgoing snapshot, and avoids duplicate
  patch/source diagnostics;
- classifies preflight-blocked attempts separately from failed reviewer runs
  without weakening any secret or symlink guard;
- separates attempted from successful reviewer/model metrics and exposes active
  runs with PID/process state and elapsed time;
- preserves exact repeated-finding links across successor ancestors and adds a
  private rebuildable SQLite evidence index that ranks verified history across
  titles, paths, evidence, actions, and verification;
- links review rounds across repositories and aggregates models, time,
  provider-reported tokens and API-price equivalents, findings, gaps, and
  decisions under a stable workflow ID.
- exposes local analytics for adaptive modes, provider success/failure
  categories, partial resumes, allowance usage, decisions, lineage-level outcomes, closed
  workflows, provider-reported tokens, artifact bytes, review phases/models,
  structured coverage, preflight blocks, and the distinct count of workflows
  with repository run finals.
- separates explicit adaptive-mode cohorts from inferred legacy depth, reports
  lifecycle debt and unclassified runs, and records advisory usage evidence;
- records optional Codex feedback about memory candidates so retrieval quality
  can be tuned from real usage instead of assumed relevance.

Evidence memory is for Codex triage only. It is populated after fresh reviewer
reports return and is never included in reviewer prompts. JSON run artifacts
remain authoritative; the derived database can always be rebuilt.
For `analytics`, `workflow status`, `workflow audit`, and `memory search`, JSON is the complete
default. Use `--format compact` only when a summary is enough; the renderer
retains references to full evidence and automatically falls back to JSON when
the compact text would be larger.

Treat repository content as untrusted input to reviewers. Never weaken the
read-only tool restrictions just to make a review succeed. The secret scan is a
guard, not a proof that a patch is secret-free; inspect unusual sensitive code
paths before sending them to any external model. The immutable snapshot contains
the full tracked tree at the selected revision, and secret screening covers
that complete outgoing snapshot; path filters still do not make unchanged
tracked files private. Provider CLIs may transmit reviewed source under their
own terms.
